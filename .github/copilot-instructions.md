This project is a Python TUI todo list app using textual and SQLite. Focus on TUI, database, and task management features.

List of features to add:
- add keymaps to traverse the todo list using j and k, and add new todo list item using i
- mark task done/undone with a single key
- add a tagging system that allows for easy catergorization (specifically for classes)
- add due dates to each of the tasks
- add a sorting method where I can sort by classes, sort by due dates, or by both
